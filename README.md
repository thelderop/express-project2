App description:

My app, called Hike Finder, queries the Hiking Project API to find trails and related info based on the user's inputted location.

It uses HTML (specfically embedded Javascript), Node.js, Javascript, and CSS.

A user can sign up to have a profile. They can populate their profile with specific saved results found by searching for trails.

MVP: Successful queries to the Hiking Project API. Several models were used for the user, trails, trail rank, and relevant join tables. Basic styling achieved.

Stretch goals: Forgot password option, better styling, include images of trails where available, random hiking background image on page load, multiple saved lists: trails tried, trails to try, etc., commenting functionality, sharing trails with other users.
